# Wireframe Data Viewer

This project is a Java program that renders a 3-dimensional triangle wireframe surface data model and allows users to rotate and scale the model for viewing from any direction. The program is designed to function as a simple CAD tool, enabling interactive manipulation of 3D models.

## Features

1. **Rotation and Scaling**
   - Rotate the 3D model using sliders.
   - Uniformly resize the model by clicking a button.
   - Real-time updates of the model during transformations.

2. **Anti-Aliasing Toggle**
   - Enable or disable anti-aliasing for smoother line rendering.

3. **Hidden Surface Removal**
   - Implement back face culling to remove hidden surfaces.
   - Implement the Painterâ€™s Algorithm to handle depth sorting.
